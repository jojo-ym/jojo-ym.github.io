            <p>Iceland, an island nation in the North Atlantic, sits on the geologic border between North America and Europe. 
                Known for its striking contrasts in climate, geography, and culture, it features Europe’s largest glacier, Vatnajökull, rugged mountain ranges, 
                and abundant hot geysers that provide heat and support year-round agriculture. Despite its northern location, 
                the Gulf Stream helps maintain a surprisingly mild climate.<br><br>
                Iceland was founded over 1,000 years ago during the Viking age by a mix of Norse and Celtic settlers, primarily Norwegian seafarers and 
                adventurers. These early settlers led further expeditions to Greenland and North America, which the Norse called Vinland.
                Although physically isolated about 500 miles from Scotland, Iceland has remained deeply connected to European civilization. 
                The Icelandic sagas, which recount heroic tales from the island's settlement period, 
                are considered some of the finest literary works of the Middle Ages. These sagas reflect a European perspective while preserving the history 
                and traditions of a people distant from the continent's commercial and cultural hubs.<br><br>
                Iceland, with its capital Reykjavík, is a modern Scandinavian country and the world's oldest democracy, yet it maintains a strong 
                connection to its traditions and customs. Major cities include Akureyri, Hafnarfjördhur, and Selfoss. Despite its modernization and 
                integration into Europe, Iceland remains ethnically homogeneous, which has benefited genetic research.

            <p>Iceland’s rugged coastline, of more than 3,000 miles (4,800 km), meets the Greenland Sea on the north, the Norwegian Sea on the east, 
            the Atlantic Ocean on the south and west, and the Denmark Strait—which separates it from Greenland by about 200 miles (320 km)—on the northwest.<br><br>
            Around one-tenth of Iceland's land is covered by glacier ice and cooled lava. The glaciers highlight the island's proximity to the Arctic Circle, 
            with Vatnajökull being the largest, covering an area equal to all of Europe's glaciers combined. Iceland's numerous volcanoes, 
            located atop the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, have contributed about one-third of the Earth's total lava flow since 1500.<br><br>
            Geologically young, Iceland contains about 200 volcanoes of various types. A new volcano erupting on the bottom of the sea between 
            November 1963 and June 1967 created the island of Surtsey, off the southwestern coast. The new island grew to about 1 square mile 
            (2.5 square km) in area and rose more than 560 feet (170 metres) above sea level, a total of 950 feet (290 metres) from the ocean floor.<br><br>
            Since the 1970s, Iceland has experienced frequent volcanic activity. A major eruption occurred in 1973 on Heima Island, 
            destroying a third of the town of Vestmannaeyjar and forcing the evacuation of over 5,000 residents. Continuous eruptions took place in 
            the Krafla area from 1975 to 1984, damaging a geothermal project. Iceland's famous volcano, Hekla, erupted several times in the 20th 
            century, and smaller eruptions occurred in 2000. Other significant eruptions include those in the Vatnajökull area in 1983 and 1996, 
            and the Eyjafjallajökull eruption in 2010, which disrupted European air traffic for days.

            <p>The climate of Iceland is maritime subarctic. It is influenced by the location of the country on the broad boundary between two contrasting 
                air currents, one of polar and the other of tropical origin. The climate is affected also by the confluence of two ocean currents: 
                the Gulf Stream, from near the Equator, and the East Greenland Current. The latter sometimes carries Arctic drift ice to Iceland’s northern 
                and eastern shores.<br><br>
                Seasonal shifts in temperature and precipitation are largely the result of weather fronts crossing the North Atlantic. 
                Relatively cold weather, particularly in the northern part of the country, results from the movement of a front south of Iceland; mild, 
                rainy weather is brought by the movement of a front northeastward between Iceland and Greenland. Although its northernmost points nearly 
                touch the Arctic Circle, Iceland is much warmer than might be expected.<br><br>Temperatures do not vary much throughout the country. 
                The mean annual temperature for Reykjavík is 40 °F (4 °C). The mean January temperature is 31 °F (−0.5 °C), and the mean July 
                temperature is 51 °F (11 °C). Snow falls about 100 days per year in the northwest, about 40 in the southeast. Annual precipitation 
                ranges from 16 inches (410 mm) on some high northern plateaus to more than 160 inches (4,100 mm) on the southern slopes of some 
                ice-capped mountains. In the south it averages about 80 inches (2,000 mm). Gales are frequent, especially in winter, and occasionally 
                heavy fog may occur, but thunderstorms are rare. Although winters are fairly dark, Reykjavík averages nearly 1,300 hours of bright 
                sunshine a year.

            <p>The population of Iceland is extremely homogeneous. The inhabitants are descendants of settlers who began arriving in ad 874 
                and continued in heavy influx for about 60 years thereafter. Historians differ on the exact origin and ethnic composition of the settlers 
                but agree that between 60 and 80 percent of them were of Nordic stock from Norway. The rest, from Scotland and Ireland, were largely of 
                Celtic stock. The dominant language in the period of settlement was Old Norse, the language spoken in Norway at the time. Through the 
                centuries it has evolved into modern Icelandic, which is used throughout the country. Modern Icelanders can still read Icelandic sagas 
                in Old Norse without difficulty. There are no ethnic distinctions. The early Nordic and Celtic stocks have long since merged, and the 
                relatively small number of subsequent immigrants (the largest portion of whom are Poles) has had only a limited effect on the population 
                structure.<br><br>The Lutheran faith has been the dominant religion since the mid-16th century. More than two-thirds of the population 
                belongs to the state-supported Evangelical Lutheran church. There is freedom of religion.<br><br>Because agriculture was the chief 
                economic activity, the population of Iceland was evenly distributed throughout the inhabitable parts of the country until the end of 
                the 19th century. With the advent of the fishing industry, commerce, and services at the beginning of the 20th century, the population 
                became increasingly concentrated in towns and villages. At the beginning of the 21st century, more than 90 percent of the population 
                lived in communities of 200 or more people.

            <p>Iceland's 1944 constitution established a parliamentary democracy with a directly elected president as head of state, holding powers 
                similar to other Western European heads of state. Real power lies with the 63-member Althingi, one of the world's oldest legislative 
                assemblies. It is a unicameral body, with members serving four-year terms unless dissolved for new elections. The executive branch, 
                led by a cabinet, must maintain majority support in parliament or resign. Citizens enjoy the civil rights typical of Western democracies.<br><br>
                Local government in Iceland is chiefly responsible for primary education, municipal services, and the administration of social programs. 
                The country is divided into 17 provinces (sýslur), which are further subdivided into fewer than 100 municipalities. Since the 1970s their 
                number has decreased by nearly half as a result of consolidation. Each municipality administers local matters through an elected council.
                <br><br>In Iceland, the president, Althing (parliament), and local councils are elected every four years, with all citizens aged 18 
                and older eligible to vote. Members of the Althing are chosen through proportional representation in multimember constituencies. 
                Since the late 1970s, the Independence Party has garnered about one-third to two-fifths of the popular vote, often forming coalition 
                governments. The Progressive Party typically ranks second, primarily supported by rural areas. In 2000, three left-of-centre parties 
                united to form the Social Democratic Alliance, alongside the growing Left-Green Party.

            <p>Icelanders are proof that a small and homogeneous population can develop a rich and varied cultural life. The country’s literary heritage 
                stems from writers of the 12th to 14th centuries who vividly recorded the sagas of Iceland’s first 250 years. Other traditional arts 
                include weaving, silver crafting, and wood carving.<br><br>The Reykjavík area, which supports several professional theatres, a symphony 
                orchestra, an opera, and a number of art galleries, bookstores, cinemas, and museums, has a cultural environment that compares favourably 
                with those of cities several times its size. It also holds a biennial international art festival.<br><br>Art in Iceland was long connected with 
                religion, first with the Roman Catholic church and later with the Lutheran church. The first professional secular painters appeared 
                in Iceland in the 19th century. Gradually increasing in number, these painters—such as Jóhannes Sveinsson Kjarval, famed for his 
                portraits of Icelandic village life—highlighted the character and beauty of their country. Painting continues to thrive in Iceland, 
                where artists have fused foreign influences with local heritage. The work of 20th-century sculptor Ásmundur Sveinsson is also a 
                source of pride for Icelanders. The old traditions in silver working have been retained, the most characteristic of which is the use 
                of silver thread for ornamentation.

            <p>Iceland has no known prehistory, as it was discovered and settled by Norse people during the Viking Age, according to accounts written 
                about 250 years later. The oldest source, *Íslendingabók* (1130), places settlement between 870 and 930 CE. *Landnámabók*, a 12th-century 
                source, credits Ingólfr Arnarson as the first permanent settler in 874, establishing his homestead in Reykjavík. It lists over 400 settlers, 
                mostly from Norway, with some from other Nordic regions and Viking settlements in the British Isles.<br><br>A layer of volcanic ash, 
                dated to around 870 and found in Greenland ice, aligns with the earliest human habitation in Iceland. Archaeological evidence supports 
                this timeline, placing Iceland's settlement in the late 9th or early 10th century as part of the Norse Viking Age. The Icelandic language, 
                a Nordic tongue closely related to western Norwegian dialects, also reflects this origin.<br><br>Although unpopulated until the Viking Age, 
                Iceland may have been known earlier. The 4th-century BCE Greek explorer Pytheas described a northern land called Thule, located six days' 
                sail north of Britain. Irish hermits in the 8th century, also seeking solitude, called Iceland Thule. It is unclear if both referred to the 
                same place. Early Icelandic sources mention Irish monks living in Iceland when Norse settlers arrived, but they soon left, unwilling to share 
                the land with heathens.<br><br>Iceland was unpopulated until the Viking Age, but it may have been known to earlier explorers. 
                The 4th-century BCE Greek explorer Pytheas of Massalia referred to a northern land called Thule, which he described as being six days’ 
                sailing north of Britain. In the 8th century, Irish hermits seeking solitude also called Iceland Thule.
